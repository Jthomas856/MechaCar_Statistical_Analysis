- The vehicle length and ground clearance variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values.
- The slope of the model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is smaller than our assumed significance value of 0.05%
- The linear model effectively predicts MPG of MechaCar prototypes. The R squared value is 0.7149, meaning the model's predictions will be correct approximately 71.5% of the time.

-The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The current manufacturing data meets the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total with a variance of 62.29. Lots 1 and 2 meet the design specifcation individually with variances of 0.98 and 7.47. Lot 3 does not meet the design specification iwth a variance of 170.29.
